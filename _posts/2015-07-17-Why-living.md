title: Why living
---

{{ page.title }}
================

I've been here for 22 years, as a human being. Back and forth I struggled to
live in my own lifestyle, fulfill my dream, or something, I mean dream.  
The seeds of the future lie buried in the past. We are here because of our
father and mother, and then, because of our ancestors who tried their best
to live, they're dying to live, and we are living to die.  
Why I'm alive?  
I should be, I could be, I would be alive. The more I try to access the
treasures buried by our ancestors, the more I'd love to search.
They are awesome. I've never meant to get them, I'm travelling and hoping
not to miss any crossroads. Whatever is present, and whatever will be the
truth, in some situations. To find, to collect shells, to propagate.  
Long live the human beings, long live the humanity.  
I'm alive.
