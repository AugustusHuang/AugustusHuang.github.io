title: OOP and Category Theory

================

Once I don't know nothing about Object-Oriented programming, today I still
don't care about how to design a scheme or a project Object-Orientedly.  
If we have to make something abstract, then why don't we make it more abstract?  
I recall my mathematical background... it's in my favourite algebraic language,
it's Category Theory.  
Why I love Category Theory? Why it acts like OOP?  
Objects are objects in a category (or, 0-objects), and message passing will
be the endomorphism or function between objects. (all right, endomorphism is
function to itself.) A car is a concrete object in the category
\\(\mathbf{CAR}\\), of course viewed in a whole, and when you see closely,
it's composed by engine, wheels, etc., and there of course will be categories
corresponding to them. Now I wanna startup the engine, USCH! And the engine
goes into a new state (you can regard it as a state machine), that's
endomorphism.  
What makes OOP less attractive to me is that it says we can think how to design
but not the ability to tell the difference. In another word,
we can't tell apart two endomorphism in two categories, if one of them is
commutative and another isn't. We can't encode mathematical information into
them using OOP, and that's really boring (I mean boring).  
If we have Category Theory, we can have Topos, we can have Sheaves,
we can have another way to express Set Theory and its axioms, which describes
and will describe our world, our computer, and our programs.
OOP is cool, but I think Category Theory is marvellous.
